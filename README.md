## Project Introduction

Path Search Game is an offline game for 2 players based on n * n board.
Both players can make a path from own base to enemy base and reach their base before their opponent.
A player can only move one space at a time, and he can not go back to where he is.
After setting the path, the player changes the position and proceeds the game.
In the event of a failure, the turn goes over and the player who first arrives at the base wins.
